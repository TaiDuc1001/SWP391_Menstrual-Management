There are more than 100 types of HPV, some of which can cause health problems including genital warts and cancers. Most HPV infections go away on their own and do not cause any health problems. However, when HPV does not go away, it can cause health problems like genital warts and cancer. HPV is mainly spread through intimate skin-to-skin contact. You can get HPV by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the virus. Most people do not know they are infected and can pass the virus on to others. Regular screening and vaccination are the best ways to prevent HPV-related health issues. The HPV vaccine is safe and effective and is recommended for preteens, but can be given up to age 26 (and sometimes older). Practicing safe sex and getting regular health check-ups are also important steps in reducing your risk. If you have questions about HPV, talk to your healthcare provider for more information and guidance. In addition to vaccination, maintaining a healthy immune system through proper nutrition and lifestyle choices can help your body clear the virus more effectively. It is also important to understand that HPV can affect both men and women, and some strains are linked to cancers of the throat, anus, and penis. Open communication with partners and regular medical checkups are key to early detection and prevention. Remember, knowledge and proactive care are your best defenses against HPV and its potential complications', '2025-06-15 09:00:00');

Maintaining a healthy diet and staying hydrated can also help reduce symptoms. For some women, hormonal birth control methods can lessen period pain by regulating or even eliminating periods. If your period pain is severe or does not improve with home remedies, consult your healthcare provider to rule out underlying conditions such as endometriosis or fibroids. Remember, you do not have to suffer in silence—help is available. It is also helpful to track your symptoms in a journal or app, noting what strategies work best for you.
